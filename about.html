      <h2>About Us</h2>

      <p>
          Here at SpaceWalkers we like to use the phrase "to infinity, and beyond!"<br>
          Actually, it's only Bill that uses that phrase, because his childhood hero was Buzz Lightyear.<br>
          We love Bill, and we believe that inside every man is a Buzz, and a Woody, ready to achieve their dreams if only they had the financial resources to do so.<br>

      <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>

      <p>Oh dear. If you have to ask you'll never know. It's probably too expensive for you, anyway.</p>

      <p>The good news is that we work on a sliding scale: our fee is approximately 37% of your annual gross income.</p>

        <h3>Let's Go For A Walk</h3>

        <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic.
          The Earth was absolutely round.</p>

        <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye,
          and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
